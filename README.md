# Medium Blog Website

This project was developed with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) and [MUI](https://mui.com)

This web app gets data from the medium user account. I've used [Erice Dhawan](https://medium.com/@ericadhawan) as an example for this app.

## To run this app:
- Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/Rahman24/medium-blog`
- Navigate to the folder `cd medium-blog`
- Install the dependencies `npm install`
- Start the development server `npm start` (runs on port 3000)
